**Reflection:**
From the valuable talk by Nicholas Wong, not only do I understand about 5G and WiFi-6, but also understand the evolvement of ICT increases exponentially, even though it is during the pandemic, 
but Huawei is still able to create Huawei Engine WiFi-6 Technology. Pandemic or any kind of external hinder will not be an excuse to stall us from improving and thriving.
