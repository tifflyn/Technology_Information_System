## Industrial Talk 1 - Clarity Techwork ( Format : Poster )
**Reflection:**
According to the advice of the ex-CTO of Clarity Techworks, no matter how well you do in your job, a bad attitude will not only waste our talent but also ruin the whole community dynamic. This emphasizes that while skills are important, they are not enough on their own. Without a great attitude, someoneâ€™s talent will be wasted and disrupt the group effort.
