# Design thinking 
## is a process for solving problems by creating innovative solutions that prioritize the needs of the user. 
Therefore, it urges students to create projects that are more useful compared to visually appealing projects with nothing aligned with user needs.
Our group created a healthcare app named "Evercare" that is most useful for elderlies with only a phone, its features can be utilized completely if paired with a smartwatch.

The video link below showcases the app our group ideated how it would look like:

One of the disadvantages of this app is it requires the Internet or data to use most of the functions in the app, elderlies who don't have data will
have a hard time using the app when he's out of range of the Internet.

The app can be improved by adding which emergency department we want to call for the emergency call suggested by our professor if we only make it a 
999 phone call for an ambulance, the authorities most likely won't help us immediately when there is a lack of ambulance in government hospitals. 
Add on private hospital phone calls nearby would be so much helpful so mere 999 emergency phone calls.

While doing this project, it gives me the chance to immerse myself in the perspective of disadvantaged people, in our case, elderly people. They are 
the minority that are usually ignored by society, this inspired me to have the responsibility to innovate more applications that can tackle problems 
that advantaged people usually wonâ€™t realize. Other than that, this project allowed me to learn and improve my skills such as video editing skills, problem-solving skills, and soft skills.
