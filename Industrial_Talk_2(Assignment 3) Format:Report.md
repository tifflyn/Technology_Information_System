**Reflection**
‚ÄúBe brave to challenge yourself, life begins at the end of your comfort zone‚Äù quote by the first speaker, Encik
Mohd Hakimi Iqmal, reminds me that to strive in computer science in the future, not only soft and hard
skills are essential, but gaining a growth mindset is also important. When there is a problem, solve it instead of
stalling, only then can we improve no matter when and where we are. We cannot succeed in the long run if we only acquire essential
skill sets or growth mindsets. Therefore, I will improve both essential
skill sets and build a growth mindset to achieve my goals in life.
