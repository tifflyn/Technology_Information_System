We listened to a brief introduction about the departments of UTM and their responsible roles in supporting UTM Digital for one and a half hours. After that, we visit the lobby area, smart board meeting room, open office, and digital care multipurpose area.

After visiting UTM Digital, I can finally understand the working environment in the future if I continue to pursue the program Iâ€™m studying. This gives me a clearer target with less doubt in my pursuit; thus, the motivation comes alongside it. In addition, I feel grateful for this opportunity to visit and interview UTM digital staff for working insights and to understand essential working-related knowledge.
